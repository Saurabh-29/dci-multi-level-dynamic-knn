#Dynamic Multi Level prioritized DCI algorithm code implementation

C++ Code to run a dynamic multi-level version of [prioritized DCI algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00440). Static Multi-Level version code can be found [here](https://github.com/ke-li/dci-knn). This code add the capability of dynamic insetion and deletion of points at run-time i.e. a single point addition 
or deletion will not require to create a new tree. 

# Getting Started. 
1.  Git clone the repository
2.  Run this
```
    make
    ./output
 ```
